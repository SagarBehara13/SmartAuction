Decentralized Auction: Utlizing blockchain for an secure and decentralized auction
==================================================================================

What is Decentralized Auction?
------------------------------

Decentralized auction is an digital platform where once can host auctions for products,
bid in other hosted auctions, and claim their winning bids. The platform leverages the
blockchain technology to create a completely decentralized auction system while maintaining
transparency and security.

The decentraized auction platform is built on Matic blockchain.


Why Matic?
----------

Decentralized Apps are making huge progress but the current blockchain ecosystem is not prepared to scale as per the demand.

The issues of slow block confirmations and high gas fees need to be solved before we target mass adoption by mainstream users. And most importantly, it needs awesome user experience.

We aim to change that by simplifying the interaction between users and the decentralized world. We want to make interacting with the decentralized ecosystem so easy that anyone can do so without worrying about the complexity of the system.

What Decentralized Auction achieved ?
-----------
	-	Immutability of each bid was being registered
	-	Tracking and verification of bidding history was easier
	-	No bid cancellation’ feature was enabled to ensure fraud free Auction
	-	Smart contracts (decentralized applications) written in Solidity
	-	Secured & transparent ledger system to encompass all bidding transactions
	-	Person who is auctioning the product is ready to accept matic tokens as payment
